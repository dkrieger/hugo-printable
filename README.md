# Printable

Barebones printable hugo theme for technical writing. Intended to be
complementary to [docdock](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock) and
other unprintable documentation themes.

## Notes

- "/" is meant to be used as cover page with wkhtmltopdf.
- `_footer.md` is used for footer customization much like in docdock
- `.no-print` elements are hidden when printing
- font-awesome is included for convenience
- slightly modified [example breadcrumb partial](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/#example-breadcrumb-navigation) included in header for basic navigation.
