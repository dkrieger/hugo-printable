# Printable

Barebones printable theme for technical writing. "/" is meant to be used as
cover page with wkhtmltopdf. Intended to be complementary to
[docdock](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock)[^dd] and other unprintable
documentation themes.

[^dd]:
    NOTE: _footer.md is used for footer customization much like in docdock
